# You should know that Docker Compose works with services.
# 1 service = 1 container.
# For example, a service, a server, a client, a database...
# We use the keyword 'services' to start to create services.

  # The name of our service is "postgres_db"
  # but you can use the name of your choice.
  # Note: This may change the commands you are going to use a little bit.
